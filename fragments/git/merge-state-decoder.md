## Git: mergeStateStatus decoder (cto / reviewer)

`gh pr view <PR> --json mergeStateStatus` returns one of:

| Status | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `CLEAN` | Up-to-date, all checks green, ready to merge | Proceed with merge |
| `BEHIND` | Branch lags target — needs rebase/merge from target | Rebase or `gh pr update-branch` |
| `DIRTY` | Merge conflicts exist | Resolve in feature branch |
| `BLOCKED` | Required checks failing OR review missing OR branch protection veto | `gh pr checks` to see which check; if review missing, request it |
| `UNSTABLE` | Non-required checks failing (informational only) | Usually safe to merge; document why |
| `HAS_HOOKS` | Pre-merge hooks pending | Wait, then re-check |
| `BEHIND` + `BLOCKED` simultaneously | Multi-cause | Address whichever is fixable; recheck |

Never merge while status is `DIRTY`, `BLOCKED`, or `BEHIND`. `UNSTABLE` is judgment call — document the override in PR comment.
