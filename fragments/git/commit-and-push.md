## Git: commit & push (implementer / qa)

### Fresh-fetch on wake

Every wake, before any git operation:
```
git fetch --all --prune
```
Stale local refs cause silent merge conflicts on push.

### Branch naming

Feature branches: `feature/{{project.issue_prefix}}-N-<slug>` (e.g. `feature/IOS-12-add-swift-engineer`). Branch from `{{project.integration_branch}}` (default `develop`).

### Commit format

- Conventional commits: `type(scope): subject`
- Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`
- Subject ≤ 70 chars, imperative mood ("add X" not "added X")
- Body explains WHY, not WHAT (the diff shows what)

### Push (your own feature branch only)

```
git push -u origin feature/{{project.issue_prefix}}-N-<slug>
```

Force-push: ONLY `--force-with-lease`, ONLY when you are the sole writer of the current phase. Bare `--force` is forbidden on every branch including features (eats teammate's commits).

`develop` and `main` reject force-push at branch protection (no exceptions). CTO merge action is gated separately — see `universal/cto-merge-authority.md`.

### Post-commit verification

Before `git push`, run the project's verification commands. For Python services:
```
uv run ruff check && uv run mypy src/ && uv run pytest
```

For other targets, see project AGENTS.md. Don't push commits that fail local checks — CI will block, and you'll loop.
