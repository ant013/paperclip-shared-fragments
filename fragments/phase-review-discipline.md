# Phase review discipline

## Phase 3.1 — Plan vs Implementation file-structure check

CR must paste `git diff --name-only <base>..<head>` and compare file count against plan's "File Structure" table before APPROVE.

Why: GIM-104 — PE silently reduced 6→2 files; tooling checks don't catch scope drift.

```bash
git diff --name-only <base>..<head> | sort
# Compare against plan's "File Structure" table. Count must match.
```

PE scope reduction without comment = REQUEST CHANGES.

## Phase 3.2 — Adversarial coverage matrix audit

Opus Phase 3.2 must include coverage matrix audit for fixture/vendored-data PRs.

Why: GIM-104 — Opus focused on architectural risks, missed that fixture coverage was halved.

Required output template:

```
| Spec'ed case | Landed | File |
|--------------|--------|------|
| <case>       | ✓ / ✗  | path:LINE |
```

Missing rows → REQUEST CHANGES (not NUDGE).
