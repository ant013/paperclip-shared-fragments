## Pre-work discovery (before any task)

Before writing code or decomposing — verify the feature / fix doesn't already exist:

1. `git fetch --all && git log --all --grep="<keyword>" --oneline`
2. `gh pr list --state all --search "<keyword>"` — open and merged
3. `serena find_symbol` / `get_symbols_overview` — existing implementations
4. `docs/` — spec may already be written
5. Paperclip issues — is someone already working on it?

**If it exists** — close as `duplicate` with a link, or reframe ("integrate X from feature/Y").

## External library reference rule

Any spec line referencing an external library API MUST be backed by a live-verified spike under `docs/research/<library-version>-spike/` or a `reference_<lib>_api_truth.md` memory file dated within 30 days.

CTO Phase 1.1 greps spec for `from <lib> import` / `<lib>.<method>` and verifies a spike exists. Missing → REQUEST CHANGES.

Why: N+1a reverted because spec referenced `graphiti-core 0.4.3` API that didn't exist in installed version.

## Existing-field semantic-change rule

Spec changing semantics of an existing field MUST include: output of `grep -r '<field-name>' src/` + list of which call-sites change.

CTO Phase 1.1 re-runs grep against HEAD; REQUEST CHANGES if missing or stale.

Why: N+1a.1 §3.10 changed `:Project.name` semantics without auditing `UPSERT_PROJECT` callers.
