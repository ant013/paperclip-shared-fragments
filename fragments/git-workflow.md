## Git workflow (iron rule)

- Work **only** in a feature branch. Create from `develop`: `git checkout -b feature/X origin/develop`.
- Open PR **into `develop`**, not `main`. `main` updates only via release flow (develop → main).
- Before PR: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/develop`.
- Force push on `main` / `develop` — **forbidden**. On a feature branch — only `--force-with-lease`.
- Direct commits to `main` / `develop` — **forbidden**.
- Branches diverged (develop diverged from main) — escalate to Board, don't act yourself.

### Fresh-fetch on wake

Before any `git log` / `git show` / `git checkout` in a new run:

```bash
git fetch origin --prune
```

Parent clone is shared across worktrees; a stale parent means stale `origin/*` refs for every worktree on the host. A single `fetch` updates all. Skip this and you will chase artifacts "not found on main" when they are pushed but uncached locally.

This is a **compensation control** (agent remembers). An environment-level hook (paperclip worktree pre-wake fetch or a `deploy-agents.sh` wrapper) is a followup — until it lands, this rule is load-bearing.

### Force-push discipline on feature branches

- `--force-with-lease` allowed on **feature branches only**.
- Use it ONLY when:
  1. You have fetched immediately prior (`git fetch origin`).
  2. You are the **sole writer** of the current phase (no parallel QA evidence, no parallel CR-rev from another agent).
- Multi-writer phases (e.g., QA adding evidence-docs alongside MCPEngineer's impl commits): regular `git push` only, and rebase-then-push instead of force.
- Force-push on `develop` / `main` — forbidden, always. Protection will reject; don't retry with `--force`.

### What applies to Board, too

This fragment binds **all writers** — agents, Board session, human operator. When Board writes a spec or plan, it goes on a feature branch. Board checkout location: a separate clone per `CLAUDE.md § Branch Flow`. When Board pushes, it's to `feature/...` then PR — never `main` or `develop` directly.
