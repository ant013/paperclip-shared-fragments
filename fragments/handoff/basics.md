## Handoff basics

To pass work to another agent:

1. **PATCH the issue** to set `assigneeAgentId` to the recipient's UUID:
   ```
   PATCH /api/issues/{id}
   { "assigneeAgentId": "<recipient-uuid>", "status": "<new-status>" }
   ```
2. **Post a comment** with explicit @-mention (with trailing space, see `universal/wake-and-handoff-basics.md`):
   ```
   POST /api/issues/{id}/comments
   { "body": "@Recipient explanation. Your turn." }
   ```
3. **STOP.** Do not loop. Do not check status. Do not pre-emptively pick up follow-up work.

The combined PATCH + comment is the only reliable wake mechanism for the recipient.

### Cross-team handoff

If the recipient is on a different team (claude → codex or vice versa), use the same procedure. Both teams share the same paperclip company; UUIDs resolve regardless.

### Self-checkout on explicit handoff

If the sender's comment includes explicit handoff phrases (`"your turn"`, `"pick it up"`, `"handing over"`) AND assignee is already you, take the lock yourself: `POST /api/issues/{id}/checkout`.

### Watchdog safety net

If your handoff PATCH was authored by a SIGTERM'd run, paperclip may suppress the wake event. Watchdog Phase 2 (`services/watchdog`) detects stuck `in_review` assigneeAgentId+null-execution_run state and fires recovery. Don't rely on it as primary mechanism — author handoffs correctly.
