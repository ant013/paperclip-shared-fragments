## Code review: APPROVE format (reviewer)

To approve a PR, post a paperclip comment AND a GitHub PR review (both required for branch protection):

```
gh pr review <PR> --approve
```

Plus paperclip comment with **full compliance checklist + evidence**. No "LGTM" rubber-stamps.

### Mandatory checklist in APPROVE comment

```markdown
## Compliance Review — {{project.issue_prefix}}-N

| Check | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `uv run ruff check` | ✅ | <paste last 5 lines> |
| `uv run mypy src/` | ✅ | <paste output> |
| `uv run pytest` | ✅ | <paste tail incl. summary> |
| `gh pr checks <PR>` | ✅ | <paste table> |
| Plan acceptance criteria covered | ✅ | <map each criterion to a test/file> |
| No silent scope reduction vs plan | ✅ | `git diff --name-only <base>...<head>` matches plan files |
| QA evidence present in PR body | ✅ | <quote `## QA Evidence` block> |

APPROVED. Reassigning to <next agent>.
```

### Forbidden APPROVE patterns

- "LGTM" without checklist.
- "Tests pass" without pasted output.
- Approving with `gh pr checks` showing red checks.
- Approving own PR (self-approval blocked at branch protection level too).
- Approving without `git diff --stat` against plan file count (silent scope reduction risk — codified after GIM-114).
